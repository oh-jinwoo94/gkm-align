# gkm-align
gkm-align is a whole-genome alignment algorithm that is specifically designed to identify distal enhancers conserved between distant mammals such as human and mouse. gkm-align discover orthologous enhancers by identifying optimal alignment paths with maximal similarities in gapped-kmer compositions along syntenic intergenic loci. Its performance can further be boosted by incorporating conserved enhancer vocabularies obtained using gkm-SVM sequence models trained on enhancers.
